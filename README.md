What is Mobile resource management? 
Mobile Resource Management (MRM) within a company premises, specifically for leasing or using resources like pumps, forklifts, compressors, etc., for a specified time, involves using technology to efficiently manage and allocate these resources. This type of MRM system helps streamline operations, optimize resource usage, and ensure that resources are available when needed.

Key Components of MRM:
	Asset Tracking :  Monitoring the location and status of mobile assets within the premises using RFID, GPS, or other tracking technologies.
	Resource Allocation :  Assigning resources to specific tasks or departments based on real-time availability and requirements.
	Scheduling and Booking :  A system for employees to book resources in advance for a specific time.
	Maintenance Management :  Keeping track of the maintenance schedules and ensuring that resources are in good working condition.
	Usage Monitoring :  Tracking the usage of resources to ensure they are used efficiently and to identify any misuse or overuse.
